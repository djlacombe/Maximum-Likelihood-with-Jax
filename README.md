# Maximum-Likelihood-with-Jax

This repository contins a Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to perform maximum likelihood estimation using Jax. 

The notebook was inspired by the following blog post from Rob Hicks: [Using Autograd for Maximum Likelihood Estimation](https://rlhick.people.wm.edu/posts/mle-autograd.html). I encourage interested individuals to read the blog post before trying to understand the notebook.

The following [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24767191/scipy-is-not-optimizing-and-returns-desired-error-not-necessarily-achieved-due) post should also be read to understand some of the changes in the function that evaluates the likelihood function.
